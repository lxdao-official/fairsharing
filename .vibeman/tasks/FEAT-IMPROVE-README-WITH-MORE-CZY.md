**Type**: doc (documentation-only update) **Priority**: low (no functional impact)

## Description

Strengthen the README so newcomers quickly understand setup, architecture, and key workflows.

## Technical Details

Keep tone consistent with existing docs; reference project commands from `README.md` and `package.json`.

## Implementation Notes

Highlight prerequisites, bootstrapping steps, and module map; link to deeper docs where available; ensure instructions match current scripts.

## Recommended Steps

- [ ] Step 1
  - [ ] Review current README to identify missing or outdated information
  - [ ] List the core topics new contributors need (setup, tooling, structure)
- [ ] Step 2
  - [ ] Rewrite or add sections covering environment setup, development workflow, and directory overview
  - [ ] Include key commands and link to supplementary docs if needed
- [ ] Step 3
  - [ ] Proofread for clarity, ensure formatting is clean, and validate internal links

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README clearly documents prerequisites, setup steps, and project structure
- [ ] All instructions reference current scripts and tooling
- [ ] Internal links and formatting render correctly in Markdown viewers

## Implementation Summary

Expanded README with structured sections for setup, workflow, and architecture, ensuring links and commands reflect the current project state.
